---:Microsoft Azure Fundamentals:---

*) Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform with an ever-expanding set of services to 
   help you build solutions to meet your business goal.

-->Cloud computing:--

  *)Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. 
    Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. 
  *)Cloud services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things 
    like Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI).

-->Describe the shared responsibility model
  *)You’ll always be responsible for:

    The information and data stored in the cloud
    Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
    The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization
  *)The cloud provider is always responsible for:

    The physical datacenter
    The physical network
    The physical hosts

--->Describe Azure Containers
   *)Containers are a virtualization environment. Much like running multiple virtual machines on a single physical host, 
     you can run multiple containers on a single physical or virtual host
   *)Containers are lightweight and designed to be created, scaled out, and stopped dynamically
   
   *)Azure Container Instances:-
     Azure Container Instances offer the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure; 
     without having to manage any virtual machines or adopt any additional services
   *)Azure Container Instances are a platform as a service (PaaS) offering. 
     Azure Container Instances allow you to upload your containers and then the service will run the containers for you.

--->Describe Azure Functions
   *)Azure Functions is an event-driven, serverless compute option that doesn’t require maintaining virtual machines or containers.
   *) Functions are commonly used when you need to perform work in response to an event (often via a REST request), timer, or message from another Azure service, 
      and when that work can be completed quickly, within seconds or less.
   *)Functions scale automatically based on demand, so they may be a good choice when demand is variable.

--->Azure App Service
   *)App Service enables you to build and host web apps, background jobs, mobile back-ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure.
     It offers automatic scaling and high availability.
   *)Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends.

--->Types of app services
      Web apps
      API apps
      WebJobs
      Mobile apps
--->Describe Azure Virtual Networking
    *)Azure virtual networks and virtual subnets enable Azure resources, such as VMs, web apps, and databases, 
      to communicate with each other, with users on the internet, and with your on-premises client computers.

--->Azure Virtual Private Networks
    *)A virtual private network (VPN) uses an encrypted tunnel within another network. 
      VPNs are typically deployed to connect two or more trusted private networks to one another over an untrusted network (typically the public internet).
    *)A VPN gateway is a type of virtual network gateway.
    *)When you deploy a VPN gateway, you specify the VPN type: either policy-based or route-based

--->Describe Azure ExpressRoute
    *)With ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365. 
    *)Connectivity can be from an any-to-any (IP VPN) network, a point-to-point Ethernet network, 
      or a virtual cross-connection through a connectivity provider at a colocation facility.

--->Describe Azure DNS
    *)Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution by using Microsoft Azure infrastructure

----->AZURE STORAGE SERVICES<-----


--->Describe Azure storage accounts
   *)A storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that's accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS.
     Data in this account is secure, highly available, durable, and massively scalable.
   *)Locally redundant storage (LRS):-Locally redundant storage (LRS) replicates your data three times within a single data center in the primary region.
                                      LRS is the lowest-cost redundancy option and offers the least durability compared to other options. 
                                      LRS protects your data against server rack and drive failures. 
                                      However, if a disaster such as fire or flooding occurs within the data center, 
                                      all replicas of a storage account using LRS may be lost or unrecoverable.

     Geo-redundant storage (GRS):-GRS copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region using LRS.
                                  It then copies your data asynchronously to a single physical location in the secondary region (the region pair) using LRS.

     Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS):-
     Zone-redundant storage (ZRS):-zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replicates your Azure Storage data synchronously 
                                  across three Azure availability zones in the primary region.

     Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS):-GZRS combines the high availability provided by redundancy across availability zones with protection 
                                          from regional outages provided by geo-replication. 
                                        Data in a GZRS storage account is copied across three Azure availability zones in the primary region (similar to ZRS) and 
                                        is also replicated to a secondary geographic region, using LRS, for protection from regional disasters.
     Read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS)

--->Describe Azure storage redundancy
   *)Azure Storage always stores multiple copies of your data so that it's protected from planned and unplanned events such as transient hardware failures,
     network or power outages, and natural disasters.

--->Describe Azure storage services
   *)Azure Blobs: A massively scalable object store for text and binary data. Also includes support for big data analytics through Data Lake Storage Gen2.
                  Azure Blob Storage is unstructured,Serving images or documents directly to a browser.Streaming video and audio.
   *)Azure Files: Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments.Azure Files offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry 
                  standard Server Message Block (SMB) or Network File System (NFS) protocols.
   *)Azure Queues: A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components.
   *)Azure Disks: Block-level storage volumes for Azure VMs.

---->Identify Azure data migration options
     Azure migration:-
     Azure Migrate is a service that helps you migrate from an on-premises environment to the cloud. 
     Azure Migrate functions as a hub to help you manage the assessment and migration of your on-premises datacenter to Azure.
     Integrated tools:-
     Azure Data Box:-Azure Data Box is a physical migration service that helps transfer large amounts of data in a quick, inexpensive, and reliable way.

---->Identify Azure file movement options
     Azure also has tools designed to help you move or interact with individual files or small file groups. 
             Among those tools are AzCopy, Azure Storage Explorer, and Azure File Sync.
     1) azcopy:-AzCopy is a command-line utility that you can use to copy blobs or files to or from your storage account. 
             With AzCopy, you can upload files, download files, copy files between storage accounts, and even synchronize files.
     2) Azure Storage Explorer:-Azure Storage Explorer is a standalone app that provides a graphical interface to manage files and blobs in your Azure Storage Account.
     3) Azure File Sync:-Azure File Sync is a tool that lets you centralize your file shares in Azure Files and 
        keep the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of a Windows file server.

----->Describe Azure identity, access, and security<------

---->Describe Azure directory services
     Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a directory service that enables you to sign in and 
     access both Microsoft cloud applications and cloud applications that you develop.
      Azure AD is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service

---->What is Azure Active Directory Domain Services?
     Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) is a service that provides managed domain services such as domain join, group policy, 
     lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP), and Kerberos/NTLM authentication
     
---->Describe Azure authentication methods
     Types:- 
     single sign-on:- ingle sign-on (SSO) enables a user to sign in one time and use that 
     credential to access multiple resources and applications from different providers.

     Multifactor Authentication:-Multifactor authentication is the process of prompting a user 
     for an extra form (or factor) of identification during the sign-in process.

     passwordless authentication:-Passwordless authentication methods are more convenient because the password is removed and
     replaced with something you have, plus something you are, or something you know.
     
---->Describe Azure external identities
     An external identity is a person, device, service, etc. that is outside your organization. 
     Azure AD External Identities refers to all the ways you can securely interact with users outside of your organization.
     
---->Describe Azure conditional access:-
     Conditional Access is a tool that Azure Active Directory uses to allow (or deny) access to resources based on identity signals. 
     These signals include who the user is, where the user is, and what device the user is requesting access from.
     
---->Describe Azure role-based access control
     Azure provides built-in roles that describe common access rules for cloud resources. You can also define your own roles. 
     Each role has an associated set of access permissions that relate to that role.
     Scopes include:

    A management group (a collection of multiple subscriptions).
    A single subscription.
    A resource group.
    A single resource.

---->Describe zero trust model
     Zero Trust is a security model that assumes the worst case scenario and protects resources with that expectation. Zero Trust assumes breach at the outset,
     The Zero Trust model flips that scenario. Instead of assuming that a device is safe because it’s within the corporate network, it requires everyone to authenticate.
     Then grants access based on authentication rather than location. 

---->Describe defense-in-depth
     The objective of defense-in-depth is to protect information and prevent it from being stolen by those who aren't authorized to access it. 
     The physical security layer is the first line of defense to protect computing hardware in the datacenter.
     The identity and access layer controls access to infrastructure and change control.
     The perimeter layer uses distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection to filter large-scale attacks before they can cause a denial of service for users.
     The network layer limits communication between resources through segmentation and access controls.
     The compute layer secures access to virtual machines.
     The application layer helps ensure that applications are secure and free of security vulnerabilities.
     The data layer controls access to business and customer data that you need to protect.

---->Describe Microsoft Defender for Cloud:-
     Defender for Cloud is a monitoring tool for security posture management and threat protection.
     It monitors your cloud, on-premises, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments to provide guidance and notifications aimed at strengthening your security posture.
  
---->Azure-native protections:-
     Azure PaaS services – Detect threats targeting Azure services including Azure App Service, Azure SQL, Azure Storage Account, and more data services. 
     You can also perform anomaly detection on your Azure activity logs using the native integration with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (formerly known as Microsoft Cloud App Security).
     Azure data services – Defender for Cloud includes capabilities that help you automatically classify your data in Azure SQL. 
     You can also get assessments for potential vulnerabilities across Azure SQL and Storage services, and recommendations for how to mitigate them.
     Networks – Defender for Cloud helps you limit exposure to brute force attacks. By reducing access to virtual machine ports, using the just-in-time VM access, you can harden your network by preventing unnecessary access.
     You can set secure access policies on selected ports, for only authorized users, allowed source IP address ranges or IP addresses, and for a limited amount of time.
