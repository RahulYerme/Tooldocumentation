********TerraForm*******

*)Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) And Open Source tool 
  that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently.
 
*)The key features of Terraform are:

   1)Infrastructure as Code

   2)Execution Plans:-Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an execution plan. 
     The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply.
   3)Uses Declarative Lang.(Define What End Result you Want.).

*)Terraform Is used For Provisioning the infrastructure Like Creating VPC,install Docker in correct Order.

*) Orchestration vs. Configuration Management:-

   --> Orchestration/provisioning is a process where we create the infrastructure â€“ virtual machines, network components, databases, etc. Whereas,
 
   --> on the other hand, configuration management is a process of automating versioned software component installation, 
       OS configuration tasks, network and firewall configuration, etc.
